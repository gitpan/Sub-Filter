NAME

Sub::Filter - automatically filter function's return value

DESCRIPTION

This module allows a function to be augmented with a filter that will be
applied to its return values.  Whenever the function returns, by whatever
means, the value (or list of values) being returned is passed through the
filter before going to the caller.  The filter may be any function, and
may perform type checking/coercion, logging, or any other manipulation.
The filtering is invisible to the body of the augmented function: the
stack shows its normal caller, not a wrapping stack frame.
