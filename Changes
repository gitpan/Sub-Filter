version 0.003; 2010-11-21

  * bugfix: on Perl 5.13.3 and above, maintain CvSTASH backrefences
    correctly

  * include a reserve implementation of the ptr_table data structure,
    because prior to Perls 5.9.5 and 5.8.9 it was not made available by
    the core if Perl is not configured for ithreads

version 0.002; 2010-10-24

  * bugfix: when applying a filter to a Perl sub, avoid letting the core
    munge entersub ops, which was causing allocation of target slots in
    the wrong pad

  * bugfix: on Perl 5.13.3+, correctly manage the CVf_CVGV_RC flag when
    applying a filter to an xsub

  * bugfix: correctly maintain PL_sv_objcount when applying a filter to
    a blessed xsub

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Sub::Mutate (for PL_sv_objcount
    correctness)

  * in XS, factor out Perl version variations into macros for greater
    readability

  * give the internal function _test_xs() a prototype

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * jump through hoops to avoid compiler warnings

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

version 0.001; 2010-07-20

  * bugfix: in XS, check SvOBJECT before looking at SvSTASH, because
    the latter isn't guaranteed to be meaningful otherwise

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Sub::Mutate (for SvSTASH safety)

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Attribute::Lexical (for
    passing package through to required code in pure-Perl version of
    Lexical::SealRequireHints)

  * port to Perl 5.13.3: use CvGV_set()

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.000; 2009-08-28

  * initial released version
